                You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. Just my luck, no ice. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!
                Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!
                Just my luck, no ice. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Yes, Yes, without the oops! Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.
                Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. You really think you can fly that thing? Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Just my luck, no ice. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!
